## 🧠 About Me

I am a software engineer who enjoys building backend and data-driven systems that reduce manual effort and scale reliably. I am especially interested in automation, data pipelines, and cloud-native applications, anything that turns repetitive processes into clean, maintainable systems.

Through industry and academic experience, I have worked across backend development, data engineering, and DevOps, building services and workflows that support real users and real workloads. I enjoy digging into performance issues, improving data reliability, and designing systems that are simple to operate and easy to extend.
